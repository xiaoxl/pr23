# Read `csv` files
A `csv` file is a plain txt file, with a fixed format. It consists of rows and columns. Rows are separated by newline symbol, which is usually `\n`. Columns are separated by a separator. Common separators include empty spaces` `, comma `,`, semi-column `;`, tab space `\t`. There might be other speical separators, depending on the creators of the specific `csv` files. 

In `pandas`, you may use `pd.read_csv()` function to read a `csv` file.
