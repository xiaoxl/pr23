## Example 1: `USA.gov` Data From `Bitly`
In 2011, URL shortening service `Bitly` partnered with the US government website
`USA.gov` to provide a feed of anonymous data gathered from users who shorten links
ending with `.gov` or `.mil`. The data is gotten from @McK2017.

The data file can be downloaded from [here](assests/datasets/example.txt). The file is mostly in JSON. It can be converted into a DataFrame by the following code.
```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import json
path = 'assests/datasets/example.txt'
df = pd.DataFrame([json.loads(line) for line in open(path)])
```
We mainly use `tz` and `a` columns. So let us clean it.

```{python}
#| warning: false
df['tz'] = df['tz'].fillna('Missing')
df['tz'][df['tz'] == ''] = 'Unknown'
df['a'] = df['a'].fillna('Missing')
df['a'][df['a'] == ''] = 'Unknown'
```


We first want to extract the timezone infomation from it. The timezone info is in the column `tz`.

```{python}
tzone = df['tz']
tvc = tzone.value_counts()
tvc
```
After cleaning data, we would like to visulize the value counts.

```{python}
import seaborn as sns
sns.barplot(x=tvc[:10].values, y=tvc[:10].index)
```

We then would like to extract information from the column `a`. This column is about the agent of the connection. The important info is the part before the space `' '`.


```{python}
agent = df['a']
agent = agent.str.split(' ').str[0]
avc = agent.value_counts()
avc[:10]
```

Now let us assume that, if `Windows` appears in column `a` the user is using `Windows` os, if not then not. In this case, the os can be detected by the following code.

```{python}
df['os'] = np.where(df['a'].str.contains('Windows'), 'Windows', 'Not Windows')
```

Now we can make a bar plot about the counts based on `os` and `timezone`.

```{python}

tz_os_counts = df.groupby(['tz', 'os']).size().unstack().fillna(0)
tz_os_counts.head()
```
We then turn it into a DataFrame using the `.stack()`, `.unstack()` tricks.

```{python}
tovc = tz_os_counts.stack()[tz_os_counts.sum(axis=1).nlargest(10).index]
tovc.name = 'count'
dftovc = pd.DataFrame(tovc).reset_index()
```
Finally we may draw the bar plot.

```{python}
sns.barplot(x='count', y='tz', hue='os', data=dftovc)
```
