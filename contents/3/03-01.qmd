## Basics

The core data structure for `numpy` is `numpy.ndarray`. It is called *NumPy N-d array*. In most cases we will use its alias `array` for simplicity. You may treat it as a generalized version of `list`. However it can do so much more than the built-in `list`. 

To use `numpy`, we just import it. In most cases you would like to use the alias `np`.

```{python}
import numpy as np
```
Using alias, we will just call NumPy N-d array `np.array`.

### Understanding `np.array`
The simplest way to look at an `np.array` is to think it as lists of list. Here are some examples.

- This is an example of a 1d array. Note that it can be treated as a list. You may get access to its entries by 1 index, e.g. `a[0]`. This means that: we have a list, and we want to get the `0`th element in the list.

```{python}
a = np.array([1, 2])
a
```

- This is an example of a 2d array. Note that it can be treated as a list of lists. You may get access to its entries by 2 indexes, e.g. `b[0, 0]`. This means that: we have a list of lists. We first get the `0`th element (which is a list), and then get the `0`th element from this `0`th list (which is a number).

```{python}
b = np.array([[1, 2], [3,4]])
b
```

- This is an example of a 3d array. Note that it can be treated as a list of lists of lists. You may get access to its entries by 3 indexes, e.g. `c[0, 0, 0]`. This means that: we have a list of lists of lists. We first get the `0`th element (which is a list of lists), and then get the `0`th element (which is a list) from this `0`th list of lists, and then get the `0`th element (which is a number) from the previous list.

```{python}
c = np.array([[[1, 2], [3,4]], [[1, 2], [3,4]]])
c
```


#### The dimension of `np.array`
There is a very confusing terminology for `np.array`: dimension. The actual word using in documents is actually `axes`. It refers to the number of coordinates required to describe the location. 

In the previous example, `a` is a 1d array since you only need 1 index to get entries, `b` is a 2d array since you need 2 indexes to get entries, and `c` is a 3d array since you need 3 indexes to get entries.

We could use `.ndim` to check the dimension of a `np.array`.

```{python}
d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
d.ndim
```

## Comparing to Linear algebras
The dimension of an `np.array` and the dimenion of a vector in Linear algebras are totally different. In this example, as a `np.array`, `a` is a 1d `np.array`, of length `3`. As a vector, it is a 3d vector.
:::

To describe the length of each axes, we could use `.shape`. It will tells us the length of each axis. In other words, it tells us the maximal index of each axis.


::: {#exm-}
```{python}
d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
d.shape
```
The shape of `d` is `(2, 3)`, which means that the length of axis 0 is `2` and the length of axis 1 is `3`. 

- Axis 0 is the vertical axis, and its index is corresponding to rows. The length of axis 0 is actually the number of rows.
- Axis 1 is the horizental axis, and its index is corresponding to columns. The length of axis 1 is actually the number of columns.

So a 2d array can be treated as a matrix, and the shape being `(2, 3)` means that the matrix has `2` rows and `3` columns.
:::

::: {.callout-caution}
`.ndim` and `.shape` are not methods. There is no `()` behind.

#### Moving along axis
A lot of `numpy` methods has an argument `axis=`, which let you to specify performing the action along which axis. You may understand this "along axis" in the following way. `axis=i` means that when we perform the action, we keep all other indexes the same, only changing the index on axis `i`.

For example, `b.sum(axis=0)` means that we want to add all entries along axis `0`. So we start from a certain entry, keeping all other index the same when changing index on axis `0` only, and add all these entries together. Since axis `0` is corresponding to rows index, only changing row index means we are moving vertically. So if `b` is a 2d array, `b.sum(axis=0)` means we are adding all column together.

We will do more examples later this section.



### Create `np.array`
`np.array` is called Numpy Ndarray. It is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers. In NumPy dimensions are called *axes*. It refers to the number of axes need to index it., and it is NOT the dimension of the vector spaces.



There are many ways to do that. 

- convert a list into a numpy array.
- `np.zeros`, `np.zeros_like`
- `np.ones`, `np.ones_like`
- `np.eye`
- `np.random.rand`
- `np.arange`
- `np.linspace`

::: {.callout-note}
Please be very careful about the format of the input. For example, when you want to specify the dimension of the array, using `np.zeros`, you need to input a `tuple`. On the other hand, when using `np.random.rand`, you just directly input the dimensions one by one.

```{python}
#| eval: false
import numpy as np

np.zeros((3, 2))
np.random.rand(3, 2)
```

In this case, the official documents are always your friend.

### Mathematical and Statistical Methods

- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, etc.. 
- `np.sin`, `np.exp`, `np.sqrt`, etc..

- `mean`, `sum`, `std`, `var`, `cumsum`
- `max` and `min`
- `maximum` and `minimum`
- `argmin` and `argmax`

- `np.sort`
- `np.unique`, `np.any`

- `np.dot`: Matrix multiplication
- `np.concatenate`

- Broadcast

## Axis
Given `A = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])` and `B = np.array([[5,6],[7,8]])`, please use `np.concatenate` to concatencate these two matrices to get a new matrix, in the order:

- `A` left, `B` right
- `A` right, `B` left
- `A` up, `B` down
- `A` down, `B` up
:::


### Common attributes and methods

- `shape`
- `dtype`
- `ndim`
- Any arithmetic operations between equal-size arrays applies the operation element-wise. 



::: {#exm-}
`MNIST` is a very famous dataset of hand written images. Here is how to load it. Note that in this instance of the dataset the data are stored as `numpy` arraies.
```{python}
#| eval: false
import tensorflow as tf

(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
X_train.shape
```
