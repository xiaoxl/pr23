## Basics

The core data structure for `numpy` is `numpy.ndarray`. It is called *NumPy N-d array*. In most cases we will use its alias `array` for simplicity. You may treat it as a generalized version of `list`. However it can do so much more than the built-in `list`. 

To use `numpy`, we just import it. In most cases you would like to use the alias `np`.

```{python}
#| eval: false
import numpy as np
```
Using alias, we will just call NumPy N-d array `np.array`.

### The dimension of `np.array`
There is a very confusing terminology for `np.array`: dimension. The actual word using in documents is actually `axes`, but all these words are used everywhere so it is benefitial to discuss it at the beginning. 

For an `np.array`, you could think it in terms of grids. You could read 


### Create `np.array`
`np.array` is called Numpy Ndarray. It is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers. In NumPy dimensions are called *axes*. It refers to the number of axes need to index it., and it is NOT the dimension of the vector spaces.



There are many ways to do that. 

- convert a list into a numpy array.
- `np.zeros`, `np.zeros_like`
- `np.ones`, `np.ones_like`
- `np.eye`
- `np.random.rand`
- `np.arange`
- `np.linspace`

::: {.callout-note}
Please be very careful about the format of the input. For example, when you want to specify the dimension of the array, using `np.zeros`, you need to input a `tuple`. On the other hand, when using `np.random.rand`, you just directly input the dimensions one by one.

```{python}
#| eval: false
import numpy as np

np.zeros((3, 2))
np.random.rand(3, 2)
```

In this case, the official documents are always your friend.

### Mathematical and Statistical Methods

- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, etc.. 
- `np.sin`, `np.exp`, `np.sqrt`, etc..

- `mean`, `sum`, `std`, `var`, `cumsum`
- `max` and `min`
- `maximum` and `minimum`
- `argmin` and `argmax`

- `np.sort`
- `np.unique`, `np.any`

- `np.dot`: Matrix multiplication
- `np.concatenate`

- Broadcast

## Axis
Given `A = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])` and `B = np.array([[5,6],[7,8]])`, please use `np.concatenate` to concatencate these two matrices to get a new matrix, in the order:

- `A` left, `B` right
- `A` right, `B` left
- `A` up, `B` down
- `A` down, `B` up

### Common attributes and methods

- `shape`
- `dtype`
- `ndim`
- Any arithmetic operations between equal-size arrays applies the operation element-wise.

`MNIST` is a very famous dataset of hand written images. Here is how to load it. Note that in this instance of the dataset the data are stored as `numpy` arraies.
```{python}
#| eval: false
import tensorflow as tf

(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
X_train.shape
```
