Here is an (incomplete) list:\n\n- `None`\n- Boolean -- `True`, `False`\n- Numeric Types — `int`, `float`, `complex`\n- Text Sequence Type — `str`\n- Sequence Types — `list`\n- Map type - `dict`\n\nWe will cover numeric types and strings in this section. The rests are either simple that are self-explained, or not simple that will be discussed later.\n\n\n\n### Numeric types and math expressions\nNumeric types are represented by numbers. If there are no confusions, Python will automatically detect the type. \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nx = 1 # x is an int.\ny = 2.0 # y is a float.\n```\n:::\n\n\nPython can do math just like other programming languages. The basic math operations are listed as follows.\n\n- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` works as normal.\n- `**` is the power operation.\n- `%` is the mod operation.\n- `!=` is `not equal`\n\n### `str`\nScalars are represented by numbers and strings are represented by quotes. Example:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nx = 1       # x is a scalar.\ny = 's'     # y is a string with one letter.\nz = '0'     # z loos like a number, but it is a string.\nw = \"Hello\" # w is a string with double quotes.\n```\n:::\n\n\nHere are some facts.\n\n1. For strings, you can use either single quotes `'` or double quotes `\"`.\n2. `\\` is used to denote escaped words. You may find the list [Here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_escape_characters.asp). \n3. There are several types of scalars, like `int`, `float`, etc.. Usually Python will automatically determine the type of the data, but sometimes you may still want to declare them manually.\n4. You can use `int()`, `str()`, etc. to change types.\n\nAlthough `str` is a built-in type, there are tons of tricks with `str`, and there are tons of packages related to strings. Generally speaking, to play with strings, we are interested in two types of questions.\n\n- Put information together to form a string.\n- Extract information from a string.\n\nA lot of tricks of strings are related to lists. We will talk about these two tasks later. The following example is a showcase.\n\n\n<!-- ::: {.callout-note}\nThere is a very subtle relations between the variable / constant and the name of the variable / constant. We will talk about these later.\n::: -->\n\n\n::: {#exm-}\nHere is an example of playing with strings. Please play with these codes and try to understand what they do.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport re\n\ndef clean_strings(strings):\n    result = []\n    for value in strings:\n        value = value.strip()\n        value = re.sub('[!#?]', '', value)\n        value = value.title()\n        result.append(value)\n    return result\n\nstates = [' Alabama ', 'Georgia!', 'Georgia', 'georgia', 'FlOrIda',\n          'south carolina##', 'West virginia?']\nclean_strings(states)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=116}\n```\n['Alabama',\n 'Georgia',\n 'Georgia',\n 'Georgia',\n 'Florida',\n 'South Carolina',\n 'West Virginia']\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Fundamentals\nThis section is mainly based on @McK2017.\n\n### Indentation\nOne key feature about Python is that its structures (blocks) is determined by **Indentation**. \n\nLet's compare with other languages. Let's take `C` as an example.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n/*This is a C function.*/\nint f(int x){return x;}\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe block is defined by `{}` and lines are separated by `;`. `space` and `newline` are not important when `C` runs the code. It is recommended to write codes in a \"beautiful, stylish\" format for readibility, as follows. However it is not mandatary.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n/*This is a C function.*/\nint f(int x) {\n   return x;\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn Python, blocks starts from `:` and then are determined by indents. Therefore you won't see a lot of `{}` in Python, and the \"beautiful, stylish\" format is mandatary. \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# This is a Python function.\ndef f(x):\n    return x\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe default value for indentation is 4 spaces, which can be changed by users. We will just use the default value in this course.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Line break\n\nIt is usually recommended that one line of code should not be very long. If you do have one, and it cannot be shortened, you may break it into multiline codes directly in Python. However, since indentation is super important in Python, when break one line code into multilines, please make sure that everything is aligned perfectly. Please see the following example.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nresults = shotchartdetail.ShotChartDetail(\n            team_id = 0,\n            player_id = 201939,\n            context_measure_simple = 'FGA',\n            season_nullable = '2021-22',\n            season_type_all_star = 'Regular Season')\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Binary operators and comparisons\n\nMost binary operators behaves as you expected. Here I just want to mention `==` and `is`. For more operations please refer to exercises.\n\n- `==` is testing whehter these two objects have the same value.\n- `is` is testing whether these two objects are exactly the same.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nYou may use `id(x)` to check the id of the object `x`. Two objects are identical if they have the same id.\n:::\n\n\n\n<!-- ### Duck typing -->\n### `import`\n\nIn Python a module is simply a file with the .py extension containing Python code. Assume that we have a Python file `example.py` stored in the folder `assests/codes/`. The file is as follows.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# from assests/codes/example.py\n\ndef f(x):\n    print(x)\n\nA = 'You get me!'\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou may get access to this function and this string in the following way.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom assests.codes import example\n\nexample.f(example.A)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nYou get me!\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Comments\n\nAny text preceded by the hash mark (pound sign) `#` is ignored by the Python interpreter. In many IDEs you may use hotkeys to directly toggle multilines as comments. For example, in VS Code the default setting for toggling comments is `ctrl+/`.\n\n\n### Dynamic references, strong types\n\nIn some programming languages, you have to declare the variable’s name and what type of data it will hold. If a variable is declared to be a number, it can never hold a different type of value, like a string. This is called *static typing* because the type of the variable can never change.\n\nPython is a *dynamically typed* language, which means you do not have to declare a variable or what kind of\ndata the variable will hold. You can change the value and type of data at any time. This could be either great or terrible news. \n\nOn the other side, \"dynamic typed\" doesn't mean that types are not important in Python. You still have to make sure that the types of all variables meet the requirements of the operations used.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\na = 1\nb = 2\nb = '2'\nc = a + b\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this example, `b` was first assigned by a number, and then it was reassigned by a `str`. This is totally fine since Python is dynamically types. However later when adding `a` and `b`, the type error occurs since you cannot add a number and a `str`.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nYou may always use `type(x)` to detect the type of the object `x`.\n:::\n\n\n\n### Everything is an object\n\nEvery number, string, data structure, function, class, module, and so on exists in the Python interpreter in its own “box”, which is referred to as a *Python object*. \n\nEach object has an associated type (e.g., string or function) and internal data. In practice this makes the language very flexible, as even functions can be treated like any other object.\n\nEach object might have attributes and/or methods attached. \n\n\n### Mutable and immutable objects\nAn object whose internal state can be changed is *mutable*. On the other hand, *immutable* doesn’t allow any change in the object once it has been created. \n\nSome objects of built-in type that are mutable are:\n\n- Lists\n- Dictionaries\n- Sets\n\n\nSome objects of built-in type that are immutable are:\n\n- Numbers (Integer, Rational, Float, Decimal, Complex & Booleans)\n- Strings\n- Tuples\n\nIn the following courses, you will learn some of these objects. You will see that for mutable objects, there are built-in methods to modify them, like `.append()` for `list`, which append element to the end of a list. There are none for immutable objects.\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## A tricky case: Tuples are not really \"immutable\"\nYou can treat a tuple as a container, which contains some objects. The relations between the container and its contents are immutable, but the objects it holds might be mutable. Please check the following example.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=11}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ncontainer = ([1], [2])\nprint('This is `container`: ', container)\nprint('This is the id of `container`: ', id(container))\nprint('This is the id of the first list of `container`: ', id(container[0]))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThis is `container`:  ([1], [2])\nThis is the id of `container`:  1839693670272\nThis is the id of the first list of `container`:  1839693581120\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=12}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ncontainer[0].append(2)\nprint('This is the new `container`: ', container)\nprint('This is the id of the new `container`: ', id(container))\nprint('This is the id of the first list (which is updated) of the new `container`: ', id(container[0]))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThis is the new `container`:  ([1, 2], [2])\nThis is the id of the new `container`:  1839693670272\nThis is the id of the first list (which is updated) of the new `container`:  1839693581120\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can see that the tuple `container` and its first object stay the same, although we add one element to the first object.\n\nYou may understand how objects are stored by considering this example.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Flows, Logic and functions\n\n### `for` loop\n\n- `range(10)`\n- `list`\n\n### `if` conditional control\n\n\n### Functions\n\nFunctions are declared with the `def` keyword and returned from the `return` keyword.\n\n::: {#exm-}\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=13}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef my_function(x, y, z=1.5):\n    if z > 1:\n        return z * (x + y)\n    else:\n        return z / (x + y)\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nEach function can have *positional* arguments and *keyword* arguments. \n\n- `z=1.5` in above example means that the default value for `z` is `1.5`. Keyword arguments are most commonly used to specify default values.\n- If no keywords are given, all arguments will be recognized by the positions.\n- If both positional arguments and keyword arguments are given, positional arguments have to be in front. \n- The order of keyword arguments are not important.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nAlthough there are global variable, it is always ecouraged to use local variables only. This means that the variables in and out of a function (as well as classes that we will talk about later) are not the same, even if they have the same name.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Lambda function\n*lambda* function is a way of writing functions consisting of a single statment. The format is `lambda x: output of x`. \n\nPlease see the following examples.\n\n::: {#exm-}\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=14}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nf = lambda x: 2*x+1\n\nf(3)\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {#exm-}\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=15}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef apply_to_list(some_list, f):\n    return [f(x) for x in some_list]\n\nints = [4, 0, 1, 5, 6]\napply_to_list(ints, lambda x: x * 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=123}\n```\n[8, 0, 2, 10, 12]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {#exm-}\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=16}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfruits = {'banana': 3, 'apple':4, 'pear': 1, 'orange': 2}\n\nfruits_sorted = sorted(fruits.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])\nfruits_sorted\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=124}\n```\n[('pear', 1), ('orange', 2), ('banana', 3), ('apple', 4)]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\nLambda function is always used as a input parameter when it is not worth to use extra space to write a one line function. You will see several examples in the Chapter of `pandas`.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## This is a tricky but not very rare case: mutable objects as default values.\nIt is highly recommended NOT to set any mutatable objects as the default value of an input of a function. The reason is that this default object is initialized when the function is defined, not when the function is called. Then all function calls will share the same default object.\n\nA typical example is an empty list. If you use an empty list as the defaul value, that list will be passed to the next function call, which is no longer empty. Please see the following example.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=17}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef add(x=[]):\n    x.append(1)\n    return x\n\nadd()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=125}\n```\n[1]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=18}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nadd()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=126}\n```\n[1, 1]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=19}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nadd()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=127}\n```\n[1, 1, 1]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nEvery time the function is called with no arguments, the default value is used, which is the same list initialized at the beginning. The list at the begining is an empty list. But after we put things inside, it is no longer empyt.\n\nIf you want to set a mutable object as a default, the way is as follows:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=20}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef add(x=None):\n    if x is None:\n        x = list()\n    x.append(1)\n    return x\n\nadd()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=128}\n```\n[1]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=21}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nadd()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=129}\n```\n[1]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=22}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nadd()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=130}\n```\n[1]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\n## `list` \n\n`list` is a basic Python data structure. It is an ordered sequence of object types, and it is denoted by `[]`. A typical list example is `[0, 1, 2]`, which is a 3-element list.\n\nMain questions in `list` contain creating, indexing and applications.\n\n### Creating lists\nA `list` can be created simply by writing down all the elements in order and enclosed by `[]`\n\n::: {#exm-}\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=23}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nL = [0, 1, 2]\nL\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=131}\n```\n[0, 1, 2]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nAn empty list can be denoted by `[]`. \n\n\n### Indexing\nThere are two ways to get access to elements in a list: by position or by slice. \n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## By position\n\nLet `L` be a list. Then `L[i]` will return the `i`-th element in the list. \n\n- All index in Python starts from `0`. Therefore the first element is `L[0]`, the second is `L[1]`, etc..\n- Negative position means go backwards. So `L[-1]` means the last element, `L[-2]` means the second last element, etc..\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## By slicing\n`slice` is a Python object. It looks like `slice(start, stop, step)`. It represents an arithematic sequence, which starts from `start`, ends before `stop` with a step size `step`. The default step size is `1`. For example, `slice(0, 5, 1)` represents an arithematic sequence `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`. Note that `slice(0, 5, 1)` itself is a slice object, and it is NOT the list `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. \n\nLet `L` be a list, and `s=slice(start, stop, step)` be a slice. `L[s]` is the portion of the original list `L` given by the index indicated by the slice `s`, as a list. A common way to write slice is through `:`. When slicing a list, you may also use \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=24}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nL[start:stop:step]\n```\n:::\n\n\n1. The slice endes before `stop`. Therefore the right end point `stop` is not in the slice.\n2. If `step` is not specified, `step=1` is the default value.\n3. If `start` or `stop` is not specified, the default value is the first of the list or the last.\n4. `start` and `stop` follows the rules of negative positions. \n5. When slicing, the result is always a list, even if it only contains one element.\n\n::: {#exm-}\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=25}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nL = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']\nL[1:5:2]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=132}\n```\n['b', 'd']\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=26}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nL[1:3]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=133}\n```\n['b', 'c']\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=27}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nL[:-1]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=134}\n```\n['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=28}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nL[-1:0:-1]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=135}\n```\n['e', 'd', 'c', 'b']\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n\n- Access to the data\n- Slicing\n\n### Methods\n- Methods\n    - `append` \n    - `extend` and `+`\n    <!-- - `pop` -->\n    <!-- - `remove` -->\n- `in`\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=true}\n## The importance of documents\n\n::: {#exm-}\n## Sorting a list\nLet `a=[3, 1, 2]` be a list. We would like to sort the list. There are two different built-in methods. \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=29}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\na = [3, 1, 2]\nb = sorted(a)\nb\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=136}\n```\n[1, 2, 3]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe first method is straightforward and we get what we expected. However if we use the same idea, and write the codes in the following way, we will get something unexpected. \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=30}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\na = [3, 1, 2]\nb = a.sort()\nprint(b)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nNone\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`b` won't be directly printed since `b` is actually `None`.

It directly change the original list.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=31}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\na\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=138}\n```\n[1, 2, 3]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\nThis is an example to show that similar functions may behaves differently.

For example, you may find the answer to the above problems from [`sorted`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted) and [`.sort()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list.sort).\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n### Work with `for` loop\n\n- `for`\n\n\n### Work with `str`\n\n- `list()`\n- `sorted`\n\n- `str.split`\n- `str.join`\n\n\n\n\n### List Comprehension\nList Comprehension is a convenient way to create lists based on the values of an existing list.
